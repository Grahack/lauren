+ the colons to name things go nicely w the code
Lisp w/o the parens
- lots of lines
"do I need to indent?" - solved with highlight showing current associativity?
+ minimal punctuation
- expressions w more than two parts aren't great - hard to scan them for their parts

["describe-person" ["action" ["person"] [["concat" { person.name } { " " } { person.height }]]]]
