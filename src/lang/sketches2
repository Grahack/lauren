- overly complex data def
- quoting thing is hard to keep track of (see speed:...)
- the . to get previous val is kind of cool, but since different dots map to different vars, it's confusing
- the copy+mutate+return syntax makes things a bit clearer on why values are not modified in place, but there is a logical flaw because could still seem like `speed: 1; speed: 2` is mutatey
